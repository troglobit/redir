Credits should, logically, go to the following people:

Nigel Metheringham <Nigel.Metheringham@ThePLAnet.net>
	For taking the code I wrote and making it into a more stable
	sensible, and usable package.

Sam Creasey <sammy@oh.verio.com>
	Original author, but this package would be vastly inferior without
	Nigel's modifications.

Damien Miller <damien@ibs.com.au>
	Initial TCP wrappers support

Thomas Osterried <thomas@x-berg.in-berlin.de>
	Added the --bind-addr patch.

Harald Holzer <harald.holzer@eunet.at>
	Added support for FTP connection done by the client

Emmanuel Chantréau <echant@maretmanu.org>
	Added options to simulate a slow connection and to limit bandwidth

Joachim Wiberg <troglobit@gmail.com>
	Current maintainer at https://github.com/troglobit/redir
